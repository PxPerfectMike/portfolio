			<h1>Logic Dots</h1>
			<p>
				This is a game I made to showcase skills in complex logic and rendering
				techniques. It uses conditional rendering to change the dots depending
				on the logic state of the game. The layout of the game is designed with
				css grid. The animations and interactivity are handled by Framer-motion.
				The logic is handled with javascript and react hooks.
